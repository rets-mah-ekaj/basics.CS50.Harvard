#### What are computers?
- Computers are digital electronic machines that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic and logical operations.
- Computers are programmable devices that store, retrieve and process data.
- Computers are programmable electronic devices that accept raw data as input and process it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output.

#### What is Binary Language?
- Computers understand only one language, binary language.
- Binary language of computers is defined as a combination of zeros and ones. Using only zeros and ones, we represent any number that we want.
- Zero and One represent "OFF" and "ON" states in computer.

Example -
Decimal | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Binary | 000 | 001 | 010 | 011 | 100 | 101 | 110 | 111

##### Why is Decimal System Decimal and why is Binary System Binary?
Let a number be 123 (One Hundred and Twenty Three). We can represent 123 in the form of:
**(100 * 1) + (10 * 2) + (1 * 3)**.
> 'Dec' in decimal means '10'.

Hence, we can represent the number 123 in powers of 10 as well, like:
**(10<sup>2</sup> * 1) + (10<sup>1</sup> * 2) + (10<sup>0</sup> * 3)**

Similarly, we can represent the binary numbers in the powers of 2, like:
011 = (2<sup>2</sup> * 0) + (2<sup>1</sup> * 1) + (2<sup>0</sup> * 1) = (4 * 0) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 1) = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3
